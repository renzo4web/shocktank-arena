**A competitive startup simulation where AI entrepreneurs must adapt to survive**

---

## The Concept

A game-like simulation where multiple AI "players" compete to create the best startup idea—but with a twist: the world changes mid-game, forcing them to pivot or die. One AI acts as the "world builder," three AIs compete as "entrepreneurs," and one AI serves as the impartial "judge."

---

## How It Works

### Phase 1: World Creation
A "god" AI generates a unique scenario with three elements:
- A key technology
- A social conflict
- A cultural trend

*Example: "A world where AI controls all farming, but people distrust machines, and 'retro-tech' fashion is trending."*

### Phase 2: Initial Pitch
Three competing "inventor" AIs each propose a startup for this world:
- Name
- Problem it solves
- Creative solution

### Phase 3: The Shock
The "god" AI throws a curveball—an unexpected event that changes everything:
- Natural disaster
- Scientific breakthrough
- Social revolution

### Phase 4: The Pivot
Each inventor must adapt their original idea to the new reality *without losing their core identity*. This is where creativity under pressure shines.

### Phase 5: Judgment
A "judge" AI evaluates all three entrepreneurs on:
- Coherence (does it make sense?)
- Adaptive creativity (how clever was the pivot?)
- Clarity (is it easy to understand?)

## Why It's Interesting

- **Drama**: The unexpected shock creates tension and surprise
- **Competition**: Three ideas battling for first place
- **Real-world parallel**: Startups constantly face pivots—this simulates that pressure
- **Efficient**: Only ~9 API calls total, keeping costs low
